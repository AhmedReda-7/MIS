## ➢ Task Requirements:
### ▪ Find and prepare your own Dataset file [Excel or CSV] and the Dataset should:
o Contain two tables
o Contain at least five columns
o Have numeric columns
o Have a Date column
### ▪ Then Apply the following changes to your dataset using Power BI Tool:
1. Combine the two tables with each other.
2. Change the Data Type of any column that has a Decimal value to be an Integer or if your dataset doesn’t have any decimal column then change the type of any text column (UPPER, LOWER…).
3. Divide the “Date” column into three columns then rename the columns to “Year”,” month”, and “Day”.
4. Add a new column by yourself and rename it to “anything you prefer” which will contain a calculation of another numeric column (s) by applying a meaningful operation [multiplication, division…].
5. Add a new column by yourself and rename it to “anything you prefer” which will merge two columns with each other.
6. Create a Report consisting of two pages which should contain the following charts:
o Bar Chart between any two reasonable fields [on the first page].
o Pie Chart between any two reasonable fields [on the first page].
o Line Chart between any two reasonable fields [on the second page].
7. Rename your Report pages to “Task Page 1” & “Task Page 2”.
8. Add a title for your report “Practical Task Report”.
9. Apply a Report-level filter on any field (using Basic Filtering).
10. Apply a slicer on the second page.
11. Create a measure NOT a quick measure using the SUM function that calculates the total of any numeric column with a meaningful measure name and uses it in any new Chart.
